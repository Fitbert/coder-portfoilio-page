# Coder_Portfoilio_Page


## Second Challenge Week 2

This is a first generation Portfoilio project with some features. 

This is a starter porfoilio page to house our projects and showcase what new code and features we are learning. 
While we are still in the new phases of learning code, I was able to learn to research for some features such as horazontal gradiant background colors. More is to come as we progress.


## Usage

This is a first generation developer portfoilio with some features. There will be more additions in time of adding more projects.
